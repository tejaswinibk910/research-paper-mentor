Traditional methods often struggle with the complexity and variability of multimodal data, particularly in applications like intelligent production and healthcare where time series and audio data are crucial. This paper introduces Minape, a novel multimodal isotropic neural architecture that integrates time series and image data, and demonstrates its effectiveness in achieving higher accuracy and scalability in device state recognition and other applications.",

However, these approaches often require significant computational resources and large datasets, making them unsuitable for smaller datasets. In contrast, the proposed Minape architecture aims to simplify the fusion process using isotropic convolutional neural architectures, resulting in a lightweight model that requires less than 1M parameters and 12 MB of memory, making it suitable for smaller multimodal datasets.",
