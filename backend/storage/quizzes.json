        "correct_answer": "It reduces the quadratic runtime of self-attention layers, allowing for more efficient deployment on edge devices",
        "explanation": "According to the paper context, patch embedding enables handling larger image sizes and mitigating the quadratic runtime of self-attention layers in Transformers.

          "It mitigates the impact of varying data sizes on model performance, but at the cost of increased latency": "This option is incorrect because the paper does not mention increased latency as a trade-off for using patch embedding. Instead, it highlights the advantages of patch embedding in terms of handling larger image sizes and reducing quadratic runtime.",
          "It enhances the capture of local dependencies, rather than global dependencies, in image data": "This option is incorrect because the paper actually states that patch embedding allows for capturing global dependencies and relationships between patches, enhancing effective image understanding and analysis."
